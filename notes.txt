Need one div tag per customer and they are styled the same. 
Need to put a div tag for each individual customer and their specifications. 


You will need to link your javascript files first.
Once you have the links in the HTML file, you will need to write an h1 tag.
Then you will need to create a div tag and create an id to attach to your javascript.
Next you will go to customers.js and you loop through them one by one. You create DOM nodes and attach them.
